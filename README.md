# SymbolLogicProject
a program that analyzes any well formed symbolic logic sentence and generates a truth table for it

To run this program, have all the java files in one folder and then compile all of them and run the runner program. it will come up with an initial menu like the following 

Java Truth Table Parser:
please enter a logical expression below for a Truth Table.
enter a ? for help, ! for examples, or "exit" to exit

from here sentences can be inputted and a full truth table will be outputted, any single character symbol that is not a logical opperator will be used as an atomic sentence. each sentence that is entered is evaluated separately and the sentence letters are not reused.
